# React-Portfolio

## Description

Eager to strengthen my skills with React, I designed and built a personal portfolio site showcasing my work and skills. By developing the site with React, I was able to flex my knowledge of components, props, state, effects and other core React concepts. Building the portfolio gave me the opportunity to apply what I've learned about React in a practical full-stack project.
