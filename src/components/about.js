    const text = `My name is Jesse and I have always had a passion for visual creativity and art. I studied printmaking and drawing at Kendall College of Art and Design where I refined my technical skills and explored different artistic mediums.

After graduating, I wanted to find a way to apply my visual talents in another field. That's when I got the idea to collaborate with my partner to open a flower shop called Black Rabbit where I could design floral arrangements and displays. I really enjoyed taking botanical inspirations and translating them into visually pleasing compositions. Owning the shop also allowed me to flex my business muscles while still satisfying my creative urges.

While I found fulfillment in the floral industry, I've always been drawn to learning new skills. I became interested in web development after seeing the opportunities it provided to marry code with design. I was fascinated by the idea of coding as an art form and wanted to expand beyond traditional artistic mediums.

So in my spare time afforded by the business, I've enrolled in a full stack course through Michigan State. I'm enjoying the challenges of problem-solving through code as well as having full control over a site's visual presentation. My goal is to eventually transition into a career in web design and development where I can keep growing as both an artist and a developer. The digital world excites me and I'm always seeking new avenues to express myself creatively through visual and technical means.`;
